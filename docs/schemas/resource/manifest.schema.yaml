description: >-
  Defines how DSC must validate a JSON blob representing an instance of the
  DSC Resource.

# While the current implementation is somewhat confusing in the schema, I
# think it's actually easier to document. Mainly, the complexity comes from
# the expected object having exactly one property with exclusive key names.
# If a DSC Resource could specify a combination of these values, the schema
# would be less complex.
