  "description": "Defines how DSC must call the DSC Resource to delete an instance. Define this method for resources as an alternative to handling the `_exist` property in a `set` operation, which can lead to highly complex code. If the `set` operation for the resource is able to handle deleting an instance when `_exist` is `false`, set the `handlesExist` property of the set method definition to `true` instead.",
