      Defines the name of the command to run. The value must be the name of a command discoverable
      in the system's `PATH` environment variable or the full path to the command. A file extension
      is only required when the command isn't recognizable by the operating system as an
      executable.

      Defines an array of strings to pass as arguments to the command. DSC passes the arguments to
      the command in the order they're specified.

      For example, the given the following definition:

      ```json
      {
        "executable": "registry",
        "args":       ["config", "export"],
      }
      ```

      DSC invokes the command for the resource as:

      ```bash
      registry config export
      ```
